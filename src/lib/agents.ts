    story: `Real estate has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I grew up surrounded by it—watching my family serve neighbors across Northwest Arkansas and learning early on what it means to guide people through one of the biggest decisions of their lives.
    
I always had the ambition to follow in my family’s footsteps, and I had the privilege of learning the trade firsthand while working closely with my dad. Over the years, that passion only grew stronger.

Today, I’m honored to continue the legacy my family began generations ago—especially the example set by my grandma, Mary Duggar, who led Good Neighbor Realty with honesty, compassion, and excellence. I love working with both buyers and sellers, helping them find not just a house, but a place to call home.

Every client I work with becomes part of that same story—one built on faith, family, and a genuine care for people.`,
